### Dependencies
The project is ready to go when you are. Open it in your browser with the link above and get ready to make some new custom color palettes.

### Execution
#### Generating New Palettes
- On load you will see five random generated colors.
- If you wish to view an entirely new palette press the **"New Palette" button**.
- If you are satisfied with a specific color click anywhere on the color.
- When the color is locked the lock icon will toggle from an unlocked icon to a locked icon.
- If you click the **"New Palette" button** now only the unlocked colors will changed while the locked colors will remain the same.

#### Saving the Current Palette
- If you really like your currently displayed palette press the **"Save Palette" button**.
- Saved palettes will be displayed on the right hand side in the same order they were saved.
- The user is still free to lock or unlock colors as they wish.

### Deleting Saved Palettes
- When a palette is saved and displayed in the **"Saved Palettes"** section a trash icon will be display to the right of the palette.
- When a users clicks the trash icon, The specific saved palette will disappear.

### Future Additions
In the future, we hope to do the following:
- Add a feature where the user has to confirm that they wish to delete palettes form the **"Saved Palettes"** after they click the trashcan icon located next to it.
- Add a feature that will allow users the ability to select previously saved palettes to then add it back to the main screen to then edit it again.
- Add a feature that will allow a user to double-click a color in the saved palettes. After double clicking the user will then have this color-hex added to their clipboard to paste in their code where necessary.
- Add a feature that will allow the user to manually enter a hex-code value to the main palette. After entering the hex-code and clicking on the lock icon or hitting the enter/return key the specified color will be displayed and locked to randomly generate colors in the other color blocks.
